        <h1>Immigrant Children Detention Camps</h1>
        <h2>DATA78000 - GIS Final Project</h2>
      </br>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        Daily U.S. Customs and Border Protection hold migrant children in custody due to illegal immigration challenges and regulations.  We hear on the news that thousands of children are held in a detention camp somewhere in the states.  With GIS I attempted to convey and visualize where these children are coming from?  Are they coming from the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Zimbabwe, or China?  Can we see any trends over the years increasing from specific origins, age groups etc.?  How many children are kept more than 72hrs which is illegal?  Are there specific regions / originating countries with higher influx?  At what port of entries are these children being detained?  I designed a map / visualization that represents data on children and their origins that have been detained by US Customs or Border Protection between the years of 2017 – 2020.  In the form of a poster combining maps developed in QGIS to represent the detained children’s origins / citizenship globally via choropleth and or density map types.  In addition, merge visual graphs derived via another solution to provide additional insights and data such as age groups, top countries, US child detention violations and other related data.  Source data was originally obtained from the US Customs and Border Protection by The Marshall Project in response to Trump’s initiative for child detention of undocumented immigrants.  The original published article can be found here https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/10/30/500-000-kids-30-million-hours-trump-s-vast-expansion-of-child-detention using data for another topic.  The source data was captured via the “Marshall project” is a combination of two sources:
      </br>
      </br>Operations (OFO) child detentions: Detentions of children at ports of entry by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Border Patrol between mid-January of 2017 and late January of 2020.
      </br>
      </br>CBP Border Patrol (BP) child detentions: Detentions of children between ports of entry by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Field Operations between mid-January of 2017 and mid-June of 2020.
      </br>
      </br>Below is a visualization i developed for this project:  Note - Downloading will provide high resolution 48 by 36 poster size in different formats.

        <h3>Data & Methods</h3>
        SQL & Tableau was utilized for Queries, Data Exploration to look for insights and mostly data cleanup.  The most challenging part of this project was data.  I had to filter and cleanup missing data and or compensate for missing data by joining on different sources.  Tableau provided quick visuals for data.  Most of the work occurred in QGIS.  Geospatial layers reprojections, data joins by attribute or location into the vector json file to develop out the choropleth graph of the world.  The background originates from google maps applied via XYZ tiles, enhanced by layer visuals.  To bring it all together into a single poster, exported from QGIS, Tableau into Photoshop where I enhance visuals via color scheme sampling applied filters and unified structure.

        <h3>Main Findings / Results / Conclusions</h3>
        First and foremost, conclusion, GIS visualizations are a lot work!  They require a lot of detail and data refinement.  As for findings, once GIS choropleth map was completed, I could easily see where most immigrant children held in US illegal immigrant detention camps were being held.  Mostly in central America but not countries that receive a lot of attention in the media like Mexico.  The numbers double in lower central America.  European / Asia origins numbers are very low in comparison.  Age groups the highest being in 15-18 group and was surprised to find so many children under 1 year of age are also being detained with or without parents.  Between 2019 and 2020  the numbers of detainees increased by nearly 50%  due to system backups, aggressive action and children being held over the 72hr limit for detention.    Border apprehensions are much higher than the OFO visualization presents.  While the numbers are just for OFO detainees, the percentage of BP detainees is almost 12 times.  One thing is for sure, one child a detainee is one too many.
